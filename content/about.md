Welcome to my website! This website contains blog posts pertaining to linux,
windows, networking, programming, and other things I may find interesting or
useful. In the future I also plan on posting travel photos on here as I travel
to new places around the United States.

I currently work as a systems engineer in the higher education sector. Most of
my day to day work revolves around supporting Windows and Microsoft 365
infrastructure, but I do get to and enjoy using Linux from time to time. Outside
of work I am also currently pursing my BS in Information Technology at
Western Governors University.

## How this website is built

This website is built using the excellent [Hugo][hugo] static site generator,
and a [custom-built theme][theme]. I write all posts, notes, and pages using
Markdown in Visual Studio Code. As the website is largely static content, this
website is currently hosted using GitHub Pages, although I have considered
moving it to Azure.
