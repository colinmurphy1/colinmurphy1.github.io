Welcome to my website! This website contains blog posts pertaining to linux,
networking, programming, and other things I may find interesting or useful.

## Projects

Some recent projects of mine:

*   [Onkyo Remote](https://github.com/colinmurphy1/onkyo-remote) -- Web-based
    remote control software for Onkyo and Integra network-enabled stereo
    receivers.
*   [docker-ttyd](https://github.com/colinmurphy1/docker-ttyd) -- A web-based
    Linux terminal that runs in Docker. I wrote this as a training exercise on
    writing Docker images.
